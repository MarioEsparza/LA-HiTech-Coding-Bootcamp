# Mario Esparza's LA Hi Tech  Bootcamp Repo â€” [LAHiTech.org](http://www.lahitech.org/)

16 week coding bootcamp designed to develop and hone web development skills. I built interactive websites and apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS. Great way to obtain real-world experience building apps on a team by collaborating with other students via GitHub.

## Week `1` 

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Week `2` 
* JavaScript - Methods, Loops, and More!
